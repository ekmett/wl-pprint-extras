--
-- This is an implementation of the pretty printing combinators
-- described by Philip Wadler (1997). In their bare essence, the
-- combinators of Wadler are not expressive enough to describe some
-- commonly occurring layouts. The PPrint library adds new primitives
-- to describe these layouts and works well in practice.
--
-- The library is based on a single way to concatenate documents,
-- which is associative and has both a left and right unit.  This
-- simple design leads to an efficient and short implementation. The
-- simplicity is reflected in the predictable behaviour of the
-- combinators which make them easy to use in practice.
--
-- A thorough description of the primitive combinators and their
-- implementation can be found in Philip Wadler's paper
-- (1997). Additions and the main differences with his original paper
-- are:
--
-- * The nil document is called empty.
--
-- * The operator '</>' is used
-- for soft line breaks.
--
-- * There are three new primitives: 'align', 'fill' and
-- 'fillBreak'. These are very useful in practice.
--
-- * Lots of other useful combinators, like 'fillSep' and 'list'.
--
-- * There are two renderers, 'renderPretty' for pretty printing and
-- 'renderCompact' for compact output. The pretty printing algorithm
-- also uses a ribbon-width now for even prettier output.
--
-- * There are two displayers, 'displayS' for strings and 'displayIO' for
-- file based output.
--
-- * There is a 'Pretty' class.
--
-- * The implementation uses optimised representations and strictness
-- annotations.
--
-- * A type argument has been added and embedded 'effects' can be seen in
-- the SimpleDoc type.

  -- * Alignment
  --
  -- The combinators in this section can not be described by Wadler's
  -- original combinators. They align their output relative to the
  -- current output position - in contrast to @nest@ which always
  -- aligns to the current nesting level. This deprives these
  -- combinators from being \`optimal\'. In practice however they
  -- prove to be very useful. The combinators in this section should
  -- be used with care, since they are more expensive than the other
  -- combinators. For example, @align@ shouldn't be used to pretty
  -- print all top-level declarations of a language, but using @hang@
  -- for let expressions is fine.
